# olive-tree-crown-heigth-detection
The summer internship project is to detect olive tree crown height without using any reference point, using deep learning techniques.
We have explored two methods for training deep learning
models to estimate crown heights.
The first method involves training a model using 2D images. By providing a dataset of 2D
images captured from smart phone 
The second method entails generating 3D images from the 2D images and training a deep
learning model using these 3D representations.
