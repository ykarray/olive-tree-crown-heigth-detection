# olive-tree-crown-heigth-detection
The summer internship project is to detect olive tree crown height without using any reference point, using deep learning techniques.
We have explored two methods for training deep learning
models to estimate crown heights.
The first method involves training a model using 2D images. By providing a dataset of 2D
images captured from smart phone , the deep learning model can learn to infer crown height
based on visual cues and patterns present in the images. This approach leverages the extensive
capabilities of deep learning in image analysis and can potentially provide accurate crown height
estimation.
The second method entails generating 3D images from the 2D images and training a deep
learning model using these 3D representations. By incorporating spatial depth information, the
deep learning model can directly learn to estimate crown height. This approach leverages the
added dimensions offered by 3D images, which has the potential to enhance the accuracy of
crown height estimation
